[00:00.05] It's a time machine?
[00:01.43] Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc
[00:03.36] Are you trying to tell me that you built a time machine out of a DeLorean?
[00:06.64] Well, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car
[00:09.81] Why not do it with some style?
[00:24.81] 
[00:12.86] I'm the architect of tick tock tech
[00:16.57] A frequent flyer on a cosmic trek
[00:19.91] I sorted through the quarks and quirks
[00:23.08] And for once I know I made a thing that really works
[00:49.08] 
[00:26.45] It's a time machine that goes both ways
[00:29.81] To new tomorrows and to yesterdays
[00:33.14] It's a car for the stars like Captain Kirk's
[00:36.51] And for once I knew I made a thing that really works
[01:02.51] 
[00:39.77] It works! It works! It works! (It works!)
[00:43.19] In terms of the vernacular, it's spectacular!
[00:46.29] Because it works! It works! It works! (It works!)
[00:50.09] And now I've found my glory in this stainless steel DeLorean
[00:53.52] It's gratifyin' knowing I was first, because it works!
[01:20.52] 
[00:57.33] Hey Doc, who are the girls? (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
[00:59.58] I don't know, they just show up every time I start singing!
[01:02.35] (Yes, it works!)
[01:10.35] 
[01:03.84] Blunt force trauma up against your head (ah-ooh)
[01:07.00] Can put you in a coma, you could end up dead (ah-ooh)
[01:10.19] Or calling for your mama but for me instead (ah-ooh)
[01:13.73] That blunt force trauma when I slipped and hit my head
[01:17.08] Shook something loose in me, some high fruit in a tree
[01:44.08] 
[01:20.25] And that's when I could see how fluid time can be
[01:23.62] It gave me the connection (ha, ha)
[01:25.31] After decades of rejection (ha, ha)
[01:27.22] I never really thought I'd get to see how well (a-a-a-ah)
[01:55.72] 
[01:30.09] It works! It works! It works! (It works!)
[01:33.77] And with this new invention, I'll cut through the fourth dimension
[01:36.75] 'Cause it works! It works! It works! (It works!)
[01:40.34] I found what I was searching for, it's called the flux capacitor
[01:44.01] It's this year's break-through scientific first, because it works!
[02:17.01] 
[01:47.75] Ha, ha, ha, ha
[01:50.80] Aah
[01:52.68] Yes, it works!
[01:59.68] 
[01:55.36] The secret was confined
[01:58.68] And it's like I was blind, man
[02:01.84] The solution was sublime
[02:04.68] And I knew it all the time!
[02:07.92] I didn't see how I could do it
[02:10.35] Until I put my mind to it
[02:22.85] 
[02:14.16] It works! It works! It works! (It works!)
[02:17.21] A space and time funicular but it's vehicular (it works, it works, it works, it works!)
[02:20.35] Because it works! It works! (It works, it works, it works, it works!)
[02:24.05] The world will write my story in this stainless steel DeLorean
[02:33.93] The time continuum shall be traversed, because Marty
[02:59.93] 
[02:40.48] It works! It works! It works! (It works!)
[02:44.04] It works! It works! It works! (It works, It works!)
[02:49.69] It works!
